# UT Data Science Certificate
This is my work completed for University of Texas Data Analysis Certificate, starting in the Spring of 2021.
<br>Throughout this class I learned to apply Python, R, R Studio, SQL, Spark, NLP, Supervised Machine Learning, Amazon Web Services and more to data analytics and data science problems.

<br><br><B>Class 3 is titled 'Data Analytics: Predicting Customer Preferneces' and involves a fictional employer, Blackwell Electronics.
  <br>Languages/Packages:</b> R, R Studio, SQL, Machine Learning
<br><a href = "https://github.com/sjegoodman/UT-Data-Science/blob/main/C3T2.R">C3T2</a> - Class 3 Task 2 is build a classification model to predict customer preference based on incomplete data. Included in this task my work in R and a <a href = "https://github.com/sjegoodman/UT-Data-Science/blob/main/C3T2Report.pdf">written report</a>.
<br><a href = "https://github.com/sjegoodman/UT-Data-Science/blob/main/C3T3.R">C3T3</a> - Class 3 Task 3 is to create a model to predict future sales based on past sales data, as well as find which factors had the biggest impact on sales volume. Included in this task is my work in R and an <a href = "https://github.com/sjegoodman/UT-Data-Science/blob/main/C3T3SalesReport.pdf">sales prediction report</a>.
<br><a href = "https://github.com/sjegoodman/UT-Data-Science/blob/main/C3T4.R">C3T4</a> - Class 3 Task 4 is to analyze transaction data and perform a market basket analysis to find associations between products (and product types). Included in this task is my work in R and an <a href = "https://github.com/sjegoodman/UT-Data-Science/blob/main/C3T4Report.pdf">written report</a>.

<br><br><B>Class 2 is titled 'Data Science with Python' and involves a fictional customer, Credit One.
  <br>Languages/Packages:</b> Python, SQL, pandas, numpy, scikitlearn, matplotlib
<br><a href = "https://github.com/sjegoodman/UT-Data-Science/blob/main/C2T1.pptx">C2T1</a> - Class 2 Task 1 is to create a roadmap for the project. This is in the form of a slide deck.
<br><a href = "https://github.com/sjegoodman/UT-Data-Science/blob/main/C2T2.ipynb">C2T2</a> - Class 2 Task 2 is to do EDA on the Credit One data set. Included in this task is a Jupyter Notebook and an <a href = "https://github.com/sjegoodman/UT-Data-Science/blob/main/C2T2-CreditOneEDA.docx">informal written report</a>.
<br><a href = "https://github.com/sjegoodman/UT-Data-Science/blob/main/C2T3.ipynb">C2T3</a> - Class 2 Task 3 is to use maching learning on the Credit One data set, with the goal of improving the approval process for customers, and avoiding defaults. Included in this task is a Jupyter Notebook and an <a href = "https://github.com/sjegoodman/UT-Data-Science/blob/main/C2T3CreditOneFinalReport.pdf">final written report</a>.
