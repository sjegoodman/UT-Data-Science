This is my work completed for University of Texas Data Analysis Certificate, starting in the Spring of 2021.
<br>Through this class I learned to apply Python, R, R Studio, SQL, Spark, NLP, Supervised Machine Learning, Amazon Web Services and more to data analytics and data science problems. 
<br><br><B>Class 2 is titled 'Data Science with Python' and involves a fictional customer, Credit One.</b>
<br>C2T1 - Class 1 Task 1 is to create a roadmap for the project. This is in the form of a slide deck.
<br>C2T2 - Class 2 Task 2 is to do EDA on the Credit One data set. Included in this task is a Jupyter Notebook and an informal written report.
<br>C2T3 - Class 2 Task 3 is to use maching learning on the Credit One data set, with the goal of improving the approval process for customers, and avoiding defaults. Included in this task is a Jupyter Notebook and an final written report.
